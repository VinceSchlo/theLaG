# The Lab

## Install

First of all, you'll need composer. If you don't have it yet, install it.

Once it is done: 

```
composer install
```

The project uses npm, if you don't have it, install it aswell.

Once it is done: 

```
npm i
```

The project uses Sass and Babel, to run compiling on save you'll need to run two commands in two distinct terminals:

```
npm run dev-css
```

and

```
npm run dev-js
```

Now you're free to go 🤙🏼

In the end, a task manager will be integrated, allowing launching only one command for both js and css watch.
