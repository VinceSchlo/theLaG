# The Lab

## Install

First of all, you'll need composer. If you don't have it yet, install it.

Once it is done: 

```
composer install
```

The project uses npm, if you don't have it, install it aswell.

Once it is done: 

```
npm i
```

The project uses Sass, to run compiling on save: 

```
npm run dev
```

Now you're free to go 🤙🏼
